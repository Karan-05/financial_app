   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   DEBUG=True
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/financial_app
   FINANCIAL_API_KEY=your_financial_api_key
   ML_MODEL_PATH=path_to_your_ml_model.pkl
   ```

5. **Apply Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

1. **Fetching Financial Data**

   Navigate to the **Data Fetching** section to retrieve the latest financial data. Ensure your API keys are correctly configured.

2. **Backtesting Strategies**

   Access the **Backtesting** module to evaluate your investment strategies against historical data. Input your parameters and run simulations to analyze performance metrics.

3. **Machine Learning Predictions**

   Utilize the **Predictions** feature to get insights based on the integrated machine learning model. Predictions are updated periodically based on new data.

4. **Generating Reports**

   Generate comprehensive reports in PDF or view them via API endpoints. Reports include visualizations and key performance indicators to aid in decision-making.

## Code Explanation

### 1. API Integration

The application integrates with financial APIs to fetch real-time and historical market data. This is handled by dedicated Django services that manage API requests, handle rate limits, and ensure data integrity.

- **Fetching Data:** Utilizes Python's `requests` library to interact with APIs like Alpha Vantage.
- **Handling Large Datasets:** Implements pagination and asynchronous requests to manage large volumes of data efficiently.
- **API Limits:** Includes error handling and retry mechanisms to gracefully handle API rate limits and downtime.

### 2. Backtesting Logic

Robust backtesting functionality allows users to test investment strategies against historical data.

- **Strategy Implementation:** Strategies are encapsulated in modular Python classes, making them easy to extend and test.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates returns, Sharpe ratios, drawdowns, and other key indicators to assess strategy performance.
- **Code Quality:** Written with clarity and maintainability in mind, with comprehensive unit tests ensuring reliability.

### 3. Machine Learning Integration

A pre-trained machine learning model is integrated to provide predictive analytics.

- **Model Management:** The ML model is stored as a serialized file (`.pkl`) and loaded within Django views when needed.
- **Separation of Concerns:** ML logic is encapsulated in separate modules, ensuring that Django views remain clean and focused on request handling.
- **Predictions:** Users can request predictions which are served by the ML model, offering insights into potential market movements.

### 4. Reporting

Dynamic reporting features enable users to generate insightful reports with ease.

- **PDF Generation:** Utilizes libraries like ReportLab to create well-formatted PDF reports containing visualizations and metrics.
- **API Responses:** Reports can also be accessed via API endpoints in JSON format, facilitating integration with other tools or frontend frameworks.
- **Visualizations:** Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear and informative charts and graphs, enhancing the interpretability of data.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on both AWS EC2 and Heroku, ensuring high availability and scalability.
